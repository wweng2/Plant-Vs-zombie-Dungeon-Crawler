0|City Entrance|The streets that were once sleek new tarmac are now greyed by the bleaching of the sun. The road is a monochrome patchwork, each one lined with a shiny boarder of tar. Despite these fixes there are still cracks and the potholes grow larger with each passing year. The trees that were once fine saplings with soft spring foliage are now gnarled embittered trees growing tall but without strength, competing unnaturally against the towering apartment blocks they were planted too close to. Their bark is mossy from the perennial dampness and incessant rain, except a few weeks of reprieve in the summer months. The sidewalk for the most part is still smooth concrete, albeit scattered with litter and the debris of the moulting trees. The air stinks of death.|-1|1|-1|-1|
1|A Wide Street|The road is flanked by large old homes with deep red bricks. There are leaves blowing between old broken lampposts flickering in disrepair. Piles of old clothes and rotten food are scattered throughout the area. The air stinks of death.|-1|2|-1|0|
2|A Square|A wide shelf of rock overlooks a pool of water in the center of the square. The street continues around the small water feature in an east and west fashion. The small pool has thousands of  small stones that seem to glow providing a soft light creating a shimmer in the water.To the north and south the intersecting roads have been barricaded. The air stinks of death.|-1|3|-1|1|
3|A Dark Alley|A trickle of water spreads out in a thin fan pattern on this old cobblestone alley. There are a variety of burned out buildings along either side of the alley. Even an old dumpster has managed to be burned beyond repair or use. The air stinks of death.|-1|4|-1|2|
4|An Old Park|An old runoff drain fills an unexpectedly large lake surrounding by uplifted
stone.  There is litter all over the ground and there are clearly visible trails in the long grass surrounding large trees. A road leads west and a dark trail leads into a cave to the south.|-1|-1|5|3|
5|Rocky Cave|About halfway into the cave you find and deep shaft leading into a strange room.  Many smaller shafts, all caved in of course, run off in every direction where the ground was stripped of its hidden treasures.  The main shaft continues even farther down to the east though.|4|6|-1|-1|
6|An Intersection|Several dark shafts converge to this point from above.  Most are small
but one larger one with cart tracts comes from almost straight above and must be the main shaft.  It continues to here and begins to turn north.  The singing you thought you may have heard in other parts of the mine sound like that of a songbird. There are exits in every direction.|9|8|7|5|
7|A Dead End|The tunnel comes to an abrupt stop. The only exit is to the north.|6|-1|-1|-1|
8|A Dead End|The tunnel comes to an abrupt stop. The only exit is to the west.|-1|-1|-1|6|
